1.Requirements 

1.1 Dataset

Data file+vocab file+pretrained word2vec

All these can be downloaded in https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtcxwlQuQjw1jGn5kPzsH03lnG6U shared by author.

Perhaps VPN is needed if you are in China. 

Also I would like to upload the files to BaiduCloudDisk.

1.2 Environment

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04LTS with CUDA 10.1 + Pytorch 1.7
some third-party packages(easy to install with pip)

1.3 Device

Maybe 1 GPU or 2 is best. If you want more GPUs to be used, you should be able to deal with some trivial bug caused by cuda setup function.
Note that when model is trained in parallel on multiple GPUs,the speed depends on the slowest one, which is called bottleneck. 

2.Run

2.1 How to run

Change directory to the path where you clone these code and enter command:sh run.sh
It takes about 60-80 minutes to finish all the 3 experiments listed in run.sh

2.2 Model type

3 fusion modes are implemented for easy comparation, switch mode by giving command argument:

--fusion_type last -> SMN-last

--fusion_type static -> SMN-static

--fusion_type dynamic -> SMN-dynamic


2.3 Experiment settings

check all the parameters you can give : python run_train.py -help


2.4 File path

Don't forget to set :

--data_dir {the path where all the data files are saved}
 
--output_dir {the path where cached file and trained model parameters should be saved}
 
 in run.sh,
 
 or you will never get rid of "No such file or directory".
  
All that you are expected to see when program is run successfully is writen as comments in run.sh

3.Douban Conversation Corpus

Not finished yet.

4.Any issues

Don't hesitate to ask for more information ^^
